## Why build this template? **(Inspiration)**

I wanted to build a portfolio website for me and my friends so that everyone can start writing blogs show their skills online . As a **computer science** student it should be shameful that I am in my last year of college still I didn't have my own portfolio.

## To use this template:

[Clone this repo](https://github.com/aarsh21/aarsh-xyz) , Then I would like you to go to the cloned repo folder on your system and remove **.git** folder from it . So that it will remove all the information about my commits and logs of my GitHub account.Then I would like you to initialise your own git repository.

```bash
# only for Linux and Mac
git clone https://github.com/aarsh21/catpuccin-folio portfolio
cd portfolio
rm -rf .git
git init .
```
